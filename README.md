# Brain Tumor Classification using CNN

## Background
Brain tumors are abnormal growths of cells within the brain or the central spinal canal. They can be classified into various types, with glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors being some of the common types. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is considered the best technique for detecting brain tumors due to its high resolution and ability to capture detailed images of the brain.

## Dataset Details
Classes: There are four different classes in the dataset:

- Glioma tumor
- Meningioma tumor
- Pituitary tumor
- No tumor


## Techniques
Automated classification techniques using Convolutional Neural Networks have shown promising results. These techniques leverage features extracted from MRI images to accurately classify tumors into their respective categories.

## Usage
This dataset can be utilized for various machine learning tasks, including but not limited to:

- Developing and evaluating classification algorithms for brain tumor detection.
- Research in medical imaging and computer-aided diagnosis.
- Comparative studies between automated classification techniques and human experts.
